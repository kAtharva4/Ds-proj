# Description of Dataset for McDonald's India
The dataset for this project is a curated and preprocessed collection of data related to McDonald's India's digital footprint. It combines structured and unstructured data, including menu items, pricing, store information, and user-generated reviews. The primary objective of this dataset is to serve as the foundation for a comprehensive trend analysis and sentiment classification project.

Each entry in the dataset represents a specific McDonald's product, accompanied by key metadata. This includes numerical ratings, a categorized sentiment score from reviews, and other product specifications like price, calorie count, and active offers. The data has been manually aligned and cleaned to ensure consistency and relevance across various product categories such as Burgers, Beverages, and Combos.

By combining these different data types, this dataset enables two key analytical approaches:

Content-Based Analysis: Filtering and matching products based on their category, price, and offers.

Sentiment-Based Ranking: Deriving a brand perception score by analyzing customer reviews and ratings.

This dual-faceted approach allows the project to derive rich insights into consumer preferences, regional trends, and the effectiveness of digital marketing strategies in the highly competitive QSR environment.
